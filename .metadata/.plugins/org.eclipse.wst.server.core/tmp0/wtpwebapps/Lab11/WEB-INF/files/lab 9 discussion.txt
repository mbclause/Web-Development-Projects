2. (10pt) The difficult part of the previous exercise is how to get the two random numbers in doPost() in order to check the user's answer and display the result. There are several ways to do it:

	Store the two numbers in two variable of the servlet class.

	Store the two numbers in the application scope.

	Embed the two numbers in the form generated by doGet() using two hidden form fields, so 	they will be submitted to doPost() together with the user's answer.

Briefly discuss why the last approach is better than the first two. Please put your answer in lab9.html.










Answer: 

The last approach is simpler and more efficient than the other two. It requires much fewer uses of the accessor methods and also makes the variables easier to initialize. It does not even require the "init" method to be overriden. It takes advantage of the html form that needs to be generated anyway.
